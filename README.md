I always liked the maps Disco made so I was a bit sad to see that the site has been offline for a while, so that's why I tried my best to restore it from archive.org and get it online again!

The master branch has a version of the site specifically for github pages with the repo name 'FVDisco', use the original branch if you want to fork the site or host you're own.
